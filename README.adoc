= Basic Vert.x Service

image:https://img.shields.io/badge/vert.x-4.3.8-purple.svg[link="https://vertx.io"]

== Structure
There are 3 verticles and one external service verticle

The 3 verticles are

* MainVerticle class
* ServiceVerticle class
* DbVerticle class

==== MainVerticle class
corresponds to initiating the rest service and deploying the other two verticles

==== ServiceVerticle class
This will consume the events on the "poll.data" address and call the 3rd party rest service to get the data

==== DbVerticle class
This corresponds to call the database upon receiving the event on the address "database.save" and save the data to the database

This communicates with the MYSQL database and
there should be a database and table with the fields mentioned as in the code.


** #Make sure that the external.ExternalServer is running first#
